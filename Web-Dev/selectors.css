/*
  Futurelearn CSS Exercise C2.6 
*/

/*
  You're going to finish the styling for the restaurant website that we worked on before, by writing CSS. This is a slightly updated version of the code you wrote in a previous step. 

  You've been left some instructions within the code. The instructions are like a puzzle: they each get a little harder, and each builds on the knowledge you have before, and from the course so far. You've should have a PDF from the Futurelearn site showing you what the final output should look like.

  Some initial styles have been provided below. Scroll down to "START FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS HERE!", to find the rest of the instructions.
